## Analysis of Resolved Bug in Apache Commons Project

Among the issues considered solved in the Apache Commons Collections project, we have selected [COLLECTIONS-817](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/COLLECTIONS-817?jql=project%20%3D%20COLLECTIONS%20AND%20statusCategory%20%3D%20Done%20ORDER%20BY%20issuetype%20ASC%2C%20status%20ASC%2C%20priority%20ASC%2C%20updated%20DESC) as a bug that has been resolved.

### Bug Identification :
The issue was related to the **BloomFilter** class method for estimating the cardinality of the Bloom filter using a conversion from **double** to **int**. The method involved **converting a precise value into an imprecise one**, which could lead to **precision loss**.

### Bug Classification :
The bug is **local**. The issue primarily concerns the estimation of values for Bloom filters and does not affect other parts of the code or general system functionalities.

### Bug Explanation and Solution :

**Bug Explanation :**
- The method was converting a **double** value to an **int**, causing a **loss of precision**.
- The method did not properly check the shape of the argument filter.
- The method was **not symmetric**; one way was correct, but the other could lead to an error.

**Solution :**
- The proposed solution is to **remove the pass-through method** to avoid imprecision and instead document how to estimate **N**, and the size of the **union** and **intersection** with another filter.
- It is recommended to **refine argument checking** to ensure that the smaller filter is properly merged into the larger filter before performing calculations. This would ensure the **symmetry** of the method and avoid merge errors.
- Additionally, documentation should explain the expected results when the **number of bits in the filters** differs.

### 4. Addition of New Tests
