# WebAssembly

### What are the main advantages of having a formal specification for WebAssembly ?

- **Compilers can quickly turn it into machine code** that runs **faster** and **more efficiently**.
- **Easier Debugging** (to trace the issue and fix i.
- **Avoid risky behaviors** like unauthorized memory access.
- Ensures that **any valid program will either run correctly or fail**, without causing unexpected behaviors.

### Does a formal specification mean WebAssembly doesn't need testing?

While formal specifications ensure consistency across systems and platforms, testing is **still essential to verify that** implementations respect the spec and behave uniformly. It helps identify **edge cases**, **performance issues**, and **integration problems** that the specification alone may not address.
