# Mechanizing and Verifying the WebAssembly Specification

### What are the main advantages of the mechanized specification?

The mechanized specification allows for a reduction in the possibility of human error compared to traditional paper-based formalizations.

### Did it help improve the original formal specification of the language?

The Mechanizing  significantly improved the original formal specification by **identifying errors related to exception propagation and type rules**. After the **working group** was **informed** about these issues, the formal specification was **updated** accordingly.

### What other artifacts were derived from this mechanized specification?

The mechanized specification also resulted in the **creation of a verified executable interpreter** and **a type checker** that conform to the requirements of the formal model.

### How did the author verify the specification?

The author verified the specification by providing a fully automated demonstration of the type system's progress and preservation properties.

### Does this new specification remove the need for testing?

No, the new specification verifies the correctness of the specification itself. Since Isabelle isn’t bug-free, there’s no guarantee that the theory is flawless. Therefore, **testing remains essential to ensure the implementation works as expected across different platforms and scenarios**.
